In Linux, certain escaped characters have special meanings when used in commands or within double-quoted strings.
Here are some of the most commonly used special escaped characters:

1. **`\n`**: Represents a newline character. When encountered in a string, it creates a line break.

2. **`\t`**: Represents a tab character. When encountered in a string, it creates a horizontal tab space.

3. **`\r`**: Represents a carriage return character. It moves the cursor to the beginning of the line without advancing to the next line.

4. **`\b`**: Represents a backspace character. It moves the cursor one character backward, effectively erasing the character before it.

5. **`\f`**: Represents a form feed character. It causes the output device to advance to the next page or clear the screen, depending on the context.

6. **`\v`**: Represents a vertical tab character. It causes the output device to move to the next vertical tab position.

7. **`\\`**: Represents a backslash character itself. This is used to escape a backslash when you want to include it as part of a string.
